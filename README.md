# Clava

At this time, most college clubs and organizations do not have a centralized 
system in which general information, member data, and funds are managed. This 
directly impacts their ability to effectively operate by increasing the amount 
of time it takes to complete basic tasks, such as granting individual 
permissions or providing reimbursements.

The purpose of our project, Clava, is to provide college organizations with a 
suite of tools to manage their members, expenses, and documentation. Clava 
will utilize a user interface designed with functionality and ease-of-use for 
clubs in mind, with feedback directly pulled from Purdue organizations like 
the Boiler Book Club. Additionally, Clava will also provide users with access 
to a variety of managerial tools, such as a financial, documentation, and event 
hub that will help expedite all executive tasks within an organization. Due to 
all of these tools being centralized, tasks like managing member permissions 
for documentation and finances will be streamlined, and organizational 
information will be much easier to view.
